    "**Question:** How well does the logistic regression model predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the credit assessing model that was created. This model was trained using historical lending data (lending_data CSV). The factors analysed for each loan candidate were loan size, interest rate, borrower income, the ratio of debt to income, the number of accounts, derogatory marks and total debt. The target to be predicted by the model was loan_status which was either a 0 (healthy loan) or a 1( high risk for default loan). A financial institution would want to use this model to quickly predict if a new customer would be a suitable candidate for a loan at their bank, as they would not want to give out high risk loans that they would not seen a return on.The confusion matrix and classification report reveal how well the model was able to predict if customers were good or high-risk loan candidates by doing calculations on true and false positives and negatives. When looking at the classification report, three main factors were analysed:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tAccuracy- the accuracy of the model was 0.99 meaning that the ratio of correctly predicted loan outcomes to total outcomes was 0.99. This is a high accuracy rate, however as there are many more healthy loan predictions than high risk loan predictions this alone is not a good enough metric to evaluate the model as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tRecall- The recall for healthy loan status (0) was 0.99 which means 99% of healthy loans were detected out of all the observations. For high-risk loan status (1) the recall was lower at 0.91 meaning out of all the observations only 0.91% of high risk loans were detected. As the recall for healthy loans was so high there is low risk of the model incorrectly predicting false negatives (high risk)\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tPrecision- The precision value for healthy loan status was 1 meaning that there was a 1:1 ratio of correctly predicted healthy status to overall predicted healthy status, this means the false positive rate (false healthy status) for this model was negligible. For high-risk loans the precision rate was 0.85 meaning that the model only correctly predicted 0.85% of the overall predicted high-risk loans, and 0.15% were predicted incorrectly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, I would not recommend that a financial institution use this model when assessing loan candidates. Whilst the model was very accurate (0.99) the accuracy score would have been outbalanced by the much higher number of overall healthy predictions (19226) to high-risk predictions (158) as this metric takes all observations into account. The model was good at predicting the healthy loans with a recall of 0.99 and precision of 1 however for the high risk loans the recall was 0.91 and the precision was 0.85, meaning only 91% of the high-risk loans were detected by the model and only 85% of the high-risk loans that were predicted were correct. For this to be used in a real-life scenario you would want precision and recall scores in the high 90’s for both the low and high-risk loans. The bank would end up with a large number of defaulting loans if it used this model. \n"
